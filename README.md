# web3-launch
Kickstarter but with web 3

The biggest problem with Kickstarter is that its easy to create scams. This project tries to mitigate this by creating a voting contract that allows contributors to vote on spending requests. The spending requests are transaction requests directly to some vendor in service of getting the kickstarter project completed.

- A manager creates a new campaign
- Contributors contribute a minimum to a chosen campaign
- The manager creates a spending request
- Contributors vote on/approve the spending request
- The manager attempts to finalize the request, if more than 50% of contributors vote to approve then the funds are released to the vendor
