Kickstarter but with web 3

The biggest problem with Kickstarter is that its easy to create scams. This project tries to mitigate this by creating a voting contract that allows contributors to vote on spending requests. The spending requests are transaction requests directly to some vendor in service of getting the kickstarter project completed.
